# ortho_40_percent

These are the project files for my ortholinear 40 percent keyboard.
This keyboard is designed to be used with the adafruit feather(https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/boards/arm/adafruit_feather_nrf52840/doc/index.html)
and the zmk firmware.
The configuration for the zmk firmware is available on this repository https://github.com/efdev/ortho_40_percent_zmk
